        <p>
          Hawkchild DIY was formed by Hashim Ali at the young age of 15 in his
          bedroom in the Pollokshields area of Glasgow. Driven by a passion for
          unorthodox, innovative and interesting music and art forms, the
          project started off as an events promoting project. As progression
          continued and the formation of relationships with artists across the
          globe had snowballed, Hawkchild DIY developed and diversified to go on
          to release records, producing full scale professional concerts, club
          nights and European tours along with radio appearances and DJ sets. In
          2018, we see the hobby and passion of a school boy mature into a
          driving force for independent music and art on a larger scale.
